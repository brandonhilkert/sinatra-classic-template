Sinatra Classic Template
========================

This is a template for a basic Sinaatra Classic application. It uses Bundler to manage dependencies and ERB for views.

The template includes a blank "style.css" stylesheet to include application-specific CSS and includes jQuery from the Google CDN.

Hope this gets you up and running fast!

Usage
-----

````Bash
  bundle install
  ruby app.rb
````
